🌟 **My Experience:**

I began my open-source journey during **Hacktoberfest 2025**. At first, I was nervous—I thought contributing required being an expert coder. But I quickly discovered that open source values *all kinds of contributions*: fixing bugs, enhancing documentation, or adding beginner-friendly features.

My very first PR was adding an unknown job site to the repo after that i have added some of my python solutions to some repos

📌 **Advice for Beginners:**

💡 Don’t wait until you feel "ready" or "perfect." Start small—fix a typo, improve documentation, or tackle a simple feature. Every contribution matters, and each step helps you learn, grow, and become part of the open-source community. 🚀
